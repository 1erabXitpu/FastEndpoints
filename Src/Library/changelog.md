## New 🎉

- customize error response content-type globally (https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/issues/627)
- `DontAutoSend()` support for `Results<T1,T2,...>` returning handlers ()

## Improvements 🚀

- `PreSetupAsync()` for `AppFixture` to allow async work that contributes to WAF creation. (https://discord.com/channels/933662816458645504/1214837140983123979)
- automatically rewind request body with `IPlainTextRequest` if `EnableBuffering()` is used. (https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/issues/631)
