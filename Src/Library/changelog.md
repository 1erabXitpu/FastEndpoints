## New üéâ

## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>Change default redirection behavior of cookie authentication middleware</summary>

The default behavior of the ASP.NET cookie auth middleware is to automatically return a redirect response when current user is either not authenticated or unauthorized. This default behavior is not appropriate for REST APIs because there's typically no login UI page as part of the backend server to redirect to, which results in a `404 - Not Found` error which confuses people that's not familiar with the cookie auth middleware. The default behavior has now been overridden to correctly return a `401 - Unauthorized` & `403 - Forbidden` as necessary without any effort from the developer.

<details><summary>Change 'RoleClaimType' of cookie auth to non-soap value</summary>

Until now, the `CookieAuth.SignInAsync()` method was using the long soap version of 'Role Claim Type' value `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role` which is not in line with what FE uses for JWT tokens. Now both JWT & Cookie auth uses the same value from the global config which is set like below or it's default value `role`:

```csharp
app.UseFastEndpoints(c=>c.Security.RoleClaimType = "role");
```

## Fixes ü™≤

<details><summary>[HideFromDocs] attribute missing issue with the source generator</summary>

If the consuming project didn't have a `global using FastEndpoints;` statement, the generated classes would complain about not being able to located the said attribute, which has now been rectified.

</details>

<details><summary>Service registration source generator issue with third party source generators</summary>

The service registration source generator was encountering a compatibility issue with partial classes generated by other source generators such as Mapster, which has no been fixed.
