# FastEndpoints

An alternative for building RESTful Web APIs with ASP.Net 6 which encourages CQRS and Vertical Slice Architecture.

**FastEndpoints** offers a more elegant solution than the **Minimal APIs** and **MVC Controllers** with the goal of increasing developer productivity. Performance is on par with the Minimal APIs and is faster; uses less memory; and outperforms a MVC Controller by about **[34k requests per second](https://fast-endpoints.com/wiki/Benchmarks.html)** on a Ryzen 3700X desktop.
